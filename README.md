Project Structure Frontend (React or Angular) Frontend is built using either React (for MERN) or Angular (for MEAN). The folders include the following: Tech-Stack: Frontend-HTML,CSS,React Backend-MongoDB,Express,Node.JS

components pages router

Backend (Node.js with Express) The backend is built with Node.js and Express and is structured as follows: models routers controllers config server.js db

Milestone 1: Project Overview In this milestone we: Understood the general structure of a MERN project. Learnt how to initialize a new project and the basic steps involved in doing so. Understood some key functionalities of an e-commerce application, such as: User Authentication: secure login and registration. This milestone was all about preparing the ground for the upcoming stages of the project by setting up the repository and understanding the features and objectives of the application.

E-Commerce App - Milestone 2 It will set up the frontend using React and Tailwind CSS as well as the backend using Node.js. It will be using a structured folder hierarchy with both frontend and backend directories. This is the first user-facing feature: the Login Page, and it has both functionality and styling. Check out the repository for the full setup and progress.

E-Commerce App - Milestone 3 This milestone is to create the backend of the application with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Routes, controllers, models, and middleware are organized within a well-structured folder hierarchy. The server is configured to handle API requests and connects to MongoDB for storing data. Basic error handling has been added to improve debugging and user experience.

E-Commerce App - Milestone 4 This milestone involves user management and file uploads in the backend. A User Model is developed using MongoDB schemas to structure user data. A User Controller is implemented to handle user-related requests such as registration and retrieval. Multer is configured to enable file uploads, which will allow users to store images on the server. These features are added to the project repository and documented in the README.
